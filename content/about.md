Hi, I am Mackenzie Qu.

I am currently a Statistics Specialist and a Math Major at University of Toronto. I enjoy doing math and telling stories with data.

This personal website is created with the intention of showing my academic papers and blogs written in statistical language R. The subject of interests varies from NBA prediction to US election, and they are done using surveys and observational data. 

Some of the papers are completed by multiple people, more specifically, I only wrote the survey data, results, and discussion section in "MULTILEVEL REGRESSION WITH POST STRATIFICATION: POPULAR VOTE POINTS TO THE VICTORY OF JOE BIDEN" paper, the credits for other sections go to Bianca Pokhrel and Zhuoqian Li. 

For reproducing the results and accessing the raw data, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/mackenziequ).
